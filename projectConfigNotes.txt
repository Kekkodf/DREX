RIP Configuration on the routers:
- statically set the interfaces to be whatever you need, e.g.,
	set interfaces ethernet eth0 vif xx address xxx.xxx.xx.xx/xx

- commit / save / exit
- back to configure, set protocols rip interface eth0.xx for each subnet
- commit / save / exit
- in case that has to be redistributed, 
	configure + set protocols rip redistribute static
